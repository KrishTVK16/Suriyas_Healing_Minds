# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/KrishTVK16/Suriyas_Healing_Minds`
2. Click on **Settings** (top menu bar)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar (under "Code and automation")
4. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"** from the dropdown
5. Click **Save**

## Step 2: Verify the Workflow

After enabling Pages, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically run when you push to the `main` branch.

## Step 3: Access Your Site

Once the workflow completes successfully, your site will be available at:
`https://krishTVK16.github.io/Suriyas_Healing_Minds/`

## Note

The workflow file (`.github/workflows/static.yml`) is already configured correctly. You just need to enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings as described above.
